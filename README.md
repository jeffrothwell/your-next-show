# your-next-show
=================<br/><br/>

This will be a fun project that I can use to build my coding skills, adding all the bits I need as I go<br/>
Not trying to change the world yet, just have fun and learn.<br/><br/>

Basic idea - show me my ideal next phish show based on a users top song list compared <br/>
with the likelihood it will get played at the next show.<br/><br/>

Users can set their song rankings from a provided full list of phish songs (probably by frequency played)<br/>
then they can update them as their tastes change, pulling songs around in their rankings or, if needed,<br/>
relegating them to the dreaded "bathroom song" list<br/><br/>

Song predictions will come from an algorithm that looks at the full gamut of setlist data<br/>
Weightings for probably calculation can be based on:<br/>
1. overall frequency of performances of a song<br/>
2. heavier weighting toward frequency of most recent tours, reverse chronological order<br/>
3. "no-go" songs, stricken from the calculation if played the night before, or any part of a multi-night run<br/><br/>

Users could be able to see their ideal show if it was the first show of tour, ie all songs are up for grabs<br/>
and the user sees the songs they most want to hear - they tell them what to play basically<br/>
They could see most likely ideal show - all songs up for grabs but bringing in the probability of actually<br/>
seeing that song, so if "Dave's Energy Guide" ranks high on a user's favourites list, but has only been played<br/>
once every 300 shows, sorry brah, it ain't gonna happen, we don't want to get your hopes up.  Having "Wingsuit"<br/>
ranked as a top 10 favourite, although strange, would land that song on the likely-next-show setlist
because for some reason Phish play it a lot.<br/>
They could of course, also see the most likely next show based purely on probability factoring the stuff<br/>
mentioned above
